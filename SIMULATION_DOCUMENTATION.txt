# DevFlow Studio: Simulation & Mock Data Documentation

This document outlines all hardcoded data, simulated behaviors, and visual placeholders used within the DevFlow Studio application to demonstrate functionality without a live backend or active IDE connection.

## 1. Mock Data Constants
**File:** `constants.ts`

*   **`MOCK_FEEDBACK`**: A static array of `FeedbackItem` objects representing social media interactions.
    *   Includes examples from X (Twitter) and Reddit.
    *   Types include: 'question', 'bug', 'positive', 'request'.
    *   Timestamps are calculated relative to `Date.now()` (e.g., "5 mins ago").
*   **`SAMPLE_CODE_SNIPPET`**: A hardcoded string of TypeScript code using the Google GenAI SDK. This serves as the "context" passed to the draft generator when no real IDE selection is available.

## 2. Service Layer Simulations
**File:** `services/geminiService.ts`

*   **API Key Fallback / Demo Mode**:
    *   The service checks for `process.env.API_KEY`.
    *   **Simulation**: If the key is missing (which is the default state in some preview environments), the `generateDraftContent` function returns a promise that resolves after **1500ms**.
    *   **Return Value**: It returns a hardcoded "DEMO MODE" draft object:
        ```json
        {
          "title": "Update: [Context]",
          "content": "[DEMO MODE - NO API KEY]\n\nJust shipped [Context].\n\nThe flow is feeling good. #buildinpublic"
        }
        ```

## 3. Component Behavior Simulations

### Onboarding (`components/Onboarding.tsx`)
*   **Authentication Delay**: The "Connect X" and "Connect Reddit" buttons trigger a `setTimeout` of **600ms** to simulate the latency of an OAuth handshake or API verification request.
*   **State**: Connection status is stored in local component state (`config`), not persisted.

### App Root (`App.tsx`)
*   **IDE Connection Handshake**:
    *   The "Establish MCP Link" button toggles the `isIdeConnected` boolean state.
    *   **Simulation**: This bypasses actual WebSocket/HTTP checks to an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and immediately grants access to the main dashboard.
*   **Status Indicators**:
    *   The "Protocol Status" text ("MCP-Transport: Idle") in the disconnected view is static.

### Drafts Panel (`components/DraftsPanel.tsx`)
*   **Context Injection**: Calls `generateDraftContent` using the hardcoded `SAMPLE_CODE_SNIPPET` as the `codeSnippet` argument.
*   **Media Placeholder**: The "diff --git a/auth.ts" UI element is a static JSX block designed to look like a file attachment. It is not interactive and does not represent a real file difference.
*   **Session History**: The history of generated drafts is stored in local React state and wipes on page refresh.

### Feedback Panel (`components/FeedbackPanel.tsx`)
*   **Data Source**: Initializes its state directly from the `MOCK_FEEDBACK` constant.
*   **Interactions**: Reply buttons are visual only; they do not open external links or trigger API calls.

### Settings Panel (`components/SettingsPanel.tsx`)
*   **Tone Calibration**:
    *   **Import Simulation**: The "Import from X History" button injects a static string of example tweets into the calibration text area to demonstrate the feature.
    *   **Analysis Simulation**: The "Calibrate" button triggers a 3-second loading state (`analyzed`) to mimic AI processing/finetuning time before showing the success state.
*   **Connection Metadata**:
    *   "Local Host Port": Displays `http://localhost:3000/mcp`. This is a static string, not a reflected value from a server configuration.
    *   "CONNECTED" status text is hardcoded.
*   **Privacy Settings**: The ignored patterns (`.env`, `secrets/*`) are static badges.
*   **Version Info**: "DevFlow Studio v1.0.4-alpha" is a hardcoded string.
